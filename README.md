I solve problems by writing software.

I can plan, design, implement, test, deploy and monitor web applications written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). Iâ€™m most productive when using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). I use methods like [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) and [Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) and tools like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to short the time it takes to deliver the right solution the right way to clients, doing so in collaborative and iterative ways.

Iâ€™m currently a senior software engineer at [Haistack.AI](https://haistack.ai/) building software to make it easier and faster for big law firms in the United States to hire great lawyers. I was previously at [NetEngine](https://netengine.com.au/) writing APIs for clients in [advertising](https://boomtown.media/hub/), [education](https://www.go1.com/), [recruitment](https://getahead.com.au/) and [telematics](https://www.lsm.com.au/index.cfm?go=FleetSafetyManagerTelematics). Before that I joined [Agent Legend](https://www.agentlegend.com/) to improve the user experience of a marketing tool for real estate and mortgage professionals.

I started my career at the Brazilian [National Institute for Space Research](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br) coding plugins and themes for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and later maintaining geographic information systems for monitoring wildfires across the globe using tools like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), [GeoServer](https://geoserver.org/), [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Iâ€™m a Certified Associate in Project Management ([CAPM](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certified-associate-capm)) since 2021 and a Team Kanban Practitioner ([TKP](https://kanban.university/kanban-development-path/tkp/)) since 2020. I earned an associate degree in IT management from [Fatec GuaratinguetÃ¡](https://www.cps.sp.gov.br/fatecs/fatec-guaratingueta-prof-joao-mod/) in 2016.
