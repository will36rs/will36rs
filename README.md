I've been solving problems by crafting software for 10+ years.

I can plan, design, implement, test, deploy, and monitor web applications written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/preface.php) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/), being most productive when using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x#why-laravel) and [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#what-is-rails-questionmark).
I use practices like [Kanban](https://kanban.university/kanban-guide/) and [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/what-is-scrum/) and tools like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) to shorten the time it takes to deliver value to clients in collaborative and incremental ways.

I joined [LeadSimple](https://www.leadsimple.com) in 2024 as a senior software engineer. Previously, I had been with [haistack.ai](https://haistack.ai) since 2022, building legal recruiting software embedded with artificial intelligence.
Before that, I was at [NetEngine](https://netengine.com.au) in 2021, writing APIs for clients in [advertising](https://boomtown.media/hub/), [education](https://www.go1.com), [recruitment](https://getahead.com.au), and [telematics](https://www.lsm.com.au/index.cfm?go=FleetSafetyManagerTelematics).
Prior to this, I joined [Agent Legend](https://www.agentlegend.com) in 2020 to improve the user experience of a marketing automation tool for real estate and mortgage professionals.


I started my career in 2010 at the Brazilian [National Institute for Space Research](http://www.inpe.br/) (INPE), coding plugins and themes for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/about) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/) until 2013.
At INPE, I also maintained geographic information systems for monitoring wildfires across the globe using tools like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html), [GeoServer](https://geoserver.org/about/), [PostGIS](https://postgis.net), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) until 2020.

I hold [Professional Scrum Master I](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/professional-scrum-master-i-certification) (PSM I), [Professional Scrum Product Owner I](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-certification) (PSPO I), and [Professional Scrum with Kanban I](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/professional-scrum-with-kanban-certification) (PSK I) certifications since 2023.
I achieved accreditation as a [Scrum Kanban Practitioner](https://kanban.university/kanban-development-path/sbk/) (SKP) in 2023 and as a [Team Kanban Practitioner](https://kanban.university/kanban-development-path/tkp/) (TKP) in 2020.
I'm also a [Certified Associate in Project Management](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certified-associate-capm) (CAPM) since 2021.
I earned an associate degree in IT management from [Fatec GuaratinguetÃ¡](https://www.cps.sp.gov.br/fatecs/fatec-guaratingueta-prof-joao-mod/) in 2016 and a high school diploma from [CTIG/Unesp](https://www.feg.unesp.br/#!/cotec) in 2009.
